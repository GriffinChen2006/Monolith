Monolith is a proof-of-concept marketplace app with seperate seller and buyer sides. The seller side allows merchants to list their available products and categorize them. Each product can also have optional add-ons. Users can interact with these products from their side, adding them to their cart and scheduling them to be delivered to them. Each store has a unique id.
